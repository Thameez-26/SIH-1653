## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
## 1. E-waste Collection and Exchange Platforms
 Create an online platform or app where people can list their old electronics for donation, trade, or recycling. This could connect users with local e-waste collection programs or refurbishing companies, facilitating the reuse or recycling of electronics instead of throwing them away.
## 2. E-waste to Energy
Develop technologies that convert e-waste into renewable energy. This can involve using waste-to-energy plants that burn non-recyclable e-waste or utilizing specialized processes to extract energy from components like batteries, capacitors, or power supplies.
## 3. Circular Economy for Electronics Manufacturers
 Partner with electronics manufacturers to implement a take-back system where consumers can return their old devices when purchasing new ones. The manufacturers could then be responsible for recycling, refurbishing, or reusing parts from these devices to create new ones.
## 4. E-waste Harvesting from Landfills
 Launch a project focused on extracting valuable materials from e-waste already discarded in landfills. By utilizing specialized tools and techniques, companies can recover metals, plastics, and rare earth elements from e-waste sitting in waste dumps.
## 5. Zero-Waste E-waste Centers
 Create "zero-waste" e-waste recycling centers that prioritize not only recycling materials but also minimizing waste generation. These centers could feature processes that reduce energy consumption and incorporate sustainable practices for managing e-waste from start to finish.
## 6. Crowdsourced E-waste Innovation
Idea: Organize competitions or crowdsourcing initiatives where individuals, startups, and engineers can submit ideas or products for innovative ways to deal with e-waste. This could include technologies that make recycling easier or products that help disassemble e-waste efficiently.
